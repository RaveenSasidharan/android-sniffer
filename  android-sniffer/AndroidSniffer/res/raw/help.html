<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primary purpose of this application 
is to capture network packets. The status display at the bottom of 
the screen has 3 fields regarding the status of the current capture. 
The first is simply whether the sniifer is running or not. The 
sniffer will remain running when the application is closed unless you 
the application is closed via Menu-&gt;Exit.</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The “Packets Captured” status 
indicates how many packets have been captured and written to file. 
All packets captured are written to file, however only packets that 
come in when the application is visible will be available to view. 
The reason for this is that Android has limited memory and storing 
all captured packets in memory could be an issue. If displaying all 
packets is a feature that is requested, we may consider adding it in 
the future. The number of packets that can be viewed within the 
application is the number indicated by the “Viewable Packets” 
status.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Starting a Capture</B></P>
